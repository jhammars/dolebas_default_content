Like most video sharing platforms, Dolebas Inc (“we” or “us”, as applicable) collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our platform. From time to time, we may also release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our platform.

We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses but we only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain users of our platform choose to interact in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. Those users who engage in transactions with us are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the information required to process those transactions. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the interaction. We don’t disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain platform-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

We may collect and publicly display statistics about the behavior of visitors on our platform. However, we don’t disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

We only disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available on our platform, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using our platform, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

Other than to our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, third parties or the public at large.

We may occasionally send you an email. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish the message in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We try to take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
